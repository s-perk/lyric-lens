The city sleeps but we're awake
We spirit home before the break
Of dawn upon the streets
In which we live and love and breathe
And half the high-rises have turned to dust
The Fairfields now are scrap and rust
The sirens sing, the west wind howls
What once was here was holy ground
Not now
And I confess that I've lately been a mess
So I wonder where you'll sleep tonight
And decide it would be best
To stay out late and not come home
To wander Kelvingrove alone
I'm young enough to still believe
Some faded glory might just shelter me
And here is where my whole world turns
And here is where my heart returns
And here is where I've sworn and cursed
And here is where I kissed you first
In amber light shot through with rain
I swear I don't intend to waste a syllable
Each word is blessed
The truth must blaze through every single breath
Unbending, stark
A lit steeple against unending dark
And someone sprayed this on the wall:
"I love it here"
I don't at all
Do you live for the love you've found?
Some sad slow song to lay you down
And still your weary worried heart
Throw light upon your darkest dark
That unsung psalm burst into flame
That wild black night that calls your name
O river, take my bloodied bones
The toll can have my heart to hold
Do you live for the loves you've lost?
Do they linger in your thoughts?
And ever in your fitful sleeps
(In your wild and dark imaginings)
Do you ever really dream of me?
And if you did what would that mean?
O river, take my bloodied bones
The toll can have my heart to hold
Unbending, stark
A lit steeple against unending dark
O river, take my bloodied bones
The toll can have my heart to hold
